# Customer Churn Prediction ðŸ“Š

This project predicts **telecom customer churn** using Machine Learning models such as **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** in Google Colab.  
The goal is to identify customers likely to leave the service and help companies improve retention strategies.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Dataset: **Telecom Customer Churn**  
- Source: [Telecom_customer_churn.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsrscientist/DSData/master/Telecom_customer_churn.csv)  
- Rows: 7,043  
- Features: Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents, tenure, PhoneService, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges.  
- Target: **Churn** (Yes = customer left, No = customer stayed)

## ðŸ›  Steps in the Project
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Converted categorical variables into numeric (One-Hot Encoding)  
   - Scaled numerical features  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of churned vs retained customers  
   - Effect of tenure, monthly charges, and contract type on churn  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest Classifier  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: ~80%  
- **Random Forest Accuracy**: ~85%  

(Random Forest performed better due to capturing non-linear relationships.)
